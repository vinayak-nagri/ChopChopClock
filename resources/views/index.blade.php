                    The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study.
                    The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
                    separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
                    after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
